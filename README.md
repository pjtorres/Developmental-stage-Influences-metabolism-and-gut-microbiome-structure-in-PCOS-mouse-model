# Developmental Stage Influences Metabolism and Gut Microbiome Community Structure in a Hyperandrogenic Mouse Model of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Torres et al. 2017

## Here you will see the original mapping files for the two Ilumina MiSeq runs (6-20-16 and 7-14-16), the mapping file with only the 8 week (adult) PCOS mice (mapping file kina) and the final mapping file with two dropped samples because they were not hyperandrogenemic (mapping file kina NA 50 and 53). The Torres.Notebook is the python file showing how sequences were processed and analyzed for this study. Also have a biom table with OTUs not present in 25% of the sample and singletons removed, but still has samples 50 and 53. Inside the alpha diversit is the mapping file with alpha diversity outputs inserted which was used in R along with a compiled R docx (raw code and data output). 4 and 8 week merged folder will also have the compiled R dox and data used for the heatmap, and random forest. Raw sequence files can be found on figshare (https://figshare.com/s/48264e9e30aefac795ea)
